        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>Raised in Northern New Jersey, just outside of New York City, I started writing code in the 90’s. I worked as an avionics technician for 12 years before relocation to Washington. Officially, I switched careers to software a little over a decade ago where I spent several years working in startups where I was tasked with designing and building everything. Eventually I found my way into the corporate world, where I now spend most of my time somewhere between node.js express apps and front-end UI work. Typically ember.js or vue. Vue is really nice.</p>

      <h4>Tinkering</h4>
      <p>Currently, I’m working on building a self contained hydroponic home garden. Inside of a cabinet. It doesn’t end there. I’m developing a fully regulated environment, i.e., sensors will dictate when to heat or cool. Thanks to TensorFlow, it will use machine learning to send me a text if leaves start yellowing, or the plans somehow look unhealthy. Otherwise, the plan is to enjoy a nice time-lapse of basil growing. Well, that and making some fresh pesto.</p>
      <p>Someday, I’ll turn it into a youtube video.</p>

        <h4>Nerd Talk</h4>
        <h5>Things that interest me:</h5>

        <p><b class="bold"> RUBY.</b> Not only do I love the language, but the community and ideas that have come from the community are brilliant.</p>

        <p><b class="bold"> ELECTRON.</b> The ability to use web technology to build desktop apps is so exciting. The fact that popular front end frameworks all have plugins that make electron just work is even better.</p>

        <p><b class="bold"> REACT.</b> I’ve leveraged angular, ember and vue professional for the past 6 years. React managed to slip through my fingers again and again. My excuse: there’s only so many hours in the day, and sometimes I’d rather use what I already know in order to finish a project. If I had all the time in the world, I’d definitely be more familiar with React.</p>
